-Chromium-Extension-Custom-CSS-Overwriter
Simple and imperfect JS that overwrites CSS to dark background and white fonts (forced darkmode essentially).

• manifest.json contains the array holding the websites that the extension are overwriting.
• Change or add URLs to: "matches" array located inside the "content_scripts" array (inside manifest.json).
• Toggle Developer mode to on
• Load the extension as 'Load unpacked' (left top corner).
